Hi [Recruiter],

I appreciate you reaching out, but unfortunately Amazon isn't the kind of company I could be comfortable working for. From their [direct business dealings with ICE](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/23/amazon-met-with-ice-officials-over-facial-recognition-system-that-could-identify-immigrants/?utm_term=.726752e1ff5c), to their more indirect dealings with the human rights violating agency [via Palantir](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-letter-protest-palantir-ice-camps-2019-7), to their long and unapologetic record of [worker abuse and exploitation](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks) (not to mention the documented [poor quality of life of white-collar Amazon workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html)), the image of Amazon in my mind is one of profit no matter what the cost to society.

Knowing all of the above, and despite Amazon's parallel reputation as a innovative and exciting technology company, I could not, with a clear conscience, consider any employment with Amazon at the moment, unless Amazon's business orientation and values radically change. If you could please remove me from your recruitment database and cease any further communications, that would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
